I’m passionate about solving tough problems at the intersection of security, cloud, and automation. Over the past 15+ years, I’ve worked with everyone from startups to large enterprises to build secure, scalable infrastructure—whether in the cloud, on-prem, or somewhere in between.

My approach is practical: move fast, stay secure, and automate everything that can be automated. I believe in applying lean, DevOps, and security-first principles to every project. That means:

Identify risks early and design for resilience.
Automate infrastructure and security controls to reduce human error.
Build quickly, test continuously, and adapt to changing needs.
Align with compliance standards (SOC 2, ISO 27001, PCI-DSS) without slowing down delivery.

What drives me isn’t just the tech—it’s creating systems that are reliable, secure, and easy for teams to manage. I also love mentoring others in DevOps and security, especially those breaking into the industry or building their first pipelines.

When I’m not helping businesses tackle AI and cloud security challenges, I’m often contributing to open-source projects, exploring new tech, or collaborating with others to build better tools and safer systems.

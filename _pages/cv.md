# Experience
### UST - Global - Lead II - Cloud Infrastructure / DevOps Engineer
#### Apr 2021 – Present. Client: AvidXChange
My role involves coordinating with twelve teams to address their DevOps needs. Since joining the team in 2021, my responsibilities have evolved monthly to cater to the diverse requirements of these teams.

One of my notable achievements during this period was the consolidation of a single monitoring tool. Previously, the twelve teams used different monitoring tools. This process was complex, given that we had to automate the deployment of monitoring agents across more than 1000 servers in the pool, including any new additions.

To streamline this, we established a baseline profile for each team, ensuring that they only received alerts relevant to their specific needs. This allowed teams to focus on real-world issues.

Starting in 2023, I transitioned to working with the next-generation team, where I assist in developing tools and setting standards for the next generation of platforms.

Additionally, apart from my role with the client, UST entrusted me with the responsibility of interviewing and screening all new candidates to ensure they meet the client's expectations in terms of both English proficiency and technical skills.

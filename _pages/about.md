# Ahoy Hoy!
Hello and welcome, my name is Benjamin or Ben. I am a DevOps Engineer, writer and confirmed geek from Australia but currently living in Mexico. 

##### When I was younger...
Growing up in Australia, I was exposed to technology at a very young age with the Commodore 64 and Amiga 1200. I didn't grow up with a lot, but my mother did make sure that I had the internet from a young age, "I don't know if that was the best choice."

Not having a lot and being a curious kid, I learnt how to fix things. My favourite was going to the tip and finding old electronics and fixing them or making new things from the junk that I found. This is how I got my very own TV and VHS player before the age of 10. 

I don't make any exuses, but I was a bad stuident. This comes down to the fact that I was very heavly bullied, it caused me to give up.

After high school I took just under two years off and went to Japan, and actually got two certfication during this time in flower arrangement.   

Once I got back to Austraila, I went and did re-entary school and finished my high school. Then went and got a Advanced Diploma in Information Techology and Network Securit.

This site (benjamin-saul-1989.github.io) is a place I store quick posts. I guess itâ€™s the closest thing I have to a blog.

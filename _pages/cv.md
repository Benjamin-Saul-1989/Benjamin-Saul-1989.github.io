# Summary
Originally from Australia, I have called Mexico my home for the past decade, having obtained permanent residency giving me the ability to work here in Mexico.

I’ve been fascinated with computers and programming since I was young, and this interest led me to pursue a career in IT. After finishing my studies at an Australian university, I received an advanced diploma in IT with a focus on Networking and Security. I’ve also completed various certifications over the preceding years. To me, working in IT isn’t just a profession—it’s a passion that drives me to continuously learn and enhance my skills.

With over 15 years of dedicated experience in the Information Technology sector, I have had the privilege of accumulating a diverse set of skills and knowledge, fueled by my unwavering determination to excel in my field. Working alongside professionals from around the globe has exposed me to unique opportunities and perspectives, enriching my professional journey.

A staunch advocate of open-source software, I actively contribute to several open-source projects during my free time, believing in the transformative power of collaborative innovation.

Also in my spare time, I volunteer to make prosthetic arms for children, combining my passion for helping others with my skills in engineering.

In essence, I am not just an engineer; I am a multifaceted individual driven by curiosity, creativity, and a relentless pursuit of excellence.
